以前聽到 「Mysticism」或「Mystical experience」，下意識的在腦中翻譯成「神祕主義」、「神祕經驗」，直到我在撰寫 [奇幻蘑菇飛行指南](/blog/psilocybin-flight-instruction) 時把 Mysticism 丟到 Google 的搜尋框後，除了神祕主義之外，還跑出「密契主義」和「冥契主義」這兩個從沒看過的詞。

> This is my prayer. As for you, beloved Timothy, exerting yourself sincerely in mystical contempla-tion, quit the senses, the workings of the intellect, and all that may be sensed and known, and all that is not and is. For by this you may unknowingly attain, in as far as it is possible, to the one-ness of Him who is beyond all being and knowledge. Thus through indomitable, absolute and pure detachment of yourself from all things, you will be lifted up to that radiance of the divine darkness which is beyond being, surpassing all and free from all.
